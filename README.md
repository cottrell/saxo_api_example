# Manual setup

Install the hootnot library.

    pip install git+https://github.com/hootnot/saxo_openapi.git

There are simulation accounts and other accounts. Start with the simulation account.

The simulation accounts expire after 20 days. Go to https://www.developer.saxo/accounts/sim/signup to create a new one.

Then you need a token.  You can get a 24 hour token here: https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/token put it in `.cred/saxo/saxo_token.txt`

Go here to try things out: https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/explorer#/

# Example
